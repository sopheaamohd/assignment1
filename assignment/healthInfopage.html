	<h3><b>1. Base Layer (Grains):</h3></b>
	<p><b>Whole Grains:</b>Provide essential nutrients like B vitamins (e.g., B6, folate), iron, magnesium, and fiber. 
	B vitamins are important for energy production and the proper functioning of the immune system. Fiber helps support a healthy gut
	microbiome, which is vital for immune function.<br></p>
	
	<h3><b>2. Second Layer (Vegetables and Fruits):</h3></b>
	<p><b>a) Vegetables:</b> Rich in vitamins (especially A, C, and K), minerals (such as potassium and magnesium), and antioxidants. Vitamin C and other 
	antioxidants help protect cells from damage, support the production of white blood cells, and enhance the overall immune response.<br>
	<b>b) Fruits:</b> Provide similar benefits to vegetables with high levels of vitamins (notably vitamin C), fiber, and antioxidants. Many fruits 
	also contain phytochemicals that have anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.<br></p>
	
	<h3><b>3. Third Layer (Protein Sources):</b></h3>
	<p><b>a) Meats, Poultry, Fish:</b> Good sources of essential amino acids necessary for building and repairing tissues, including immune cells. Fish, 
	particularly oily fish like salmon, provides omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory effects that support immune function.<br>
	<b>b) Beans, Nuts, and Seeds:</b> Offer plant-based proteins and important nutrients like zinc and selenium. Zinc is crucial for immune cell 
	function and overall immune health, while selenium acts as an antioxidant and supports the immune system.<br></p>
	
	<h3><b>4. Top Layer (Dairy):</b></h3>
	<p><b>Milk, Yogurt, Cheese:</b> Provide protein, calcium, and vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for immune system regulation and helps the body 
	mount an effective immune response. Probiotics found in yogurt can also promote a healthy gut microbiome, which plays a key role in immune health.<br></p>
	
	<h3><b>5. Fats and Sweets (Use Sparingly):</b></h3>
	<p><b>a) Healthy Fats:</b> Include omega-3 fatty acids from sources like nuts, seeds, and olive oil, which have anti-inflammatory properties that support 
	immune function.<br>
	<b>b) Sweets:</b> Excessive sugar intake can negatively impact immune function by promoting inflammation and disrupting the balance of beneficial bacteria
	in the gut.</p><br>
