	<h3>Site Purpose</h3>
		
		<p>This website is created to spread health awareness to educate communities, improving public health, preventing diseases, and promoting wellness. 
		With the right marketing strategies, healthcare awareness can extend patient care outside of the hospital and bolster social support within niche communities.<br></p>
		
	<h3>What is the Significant of Health?</h3>
	
		<p>Your health is one of the most important things in your life. It affects your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. 
		That's why it's so important to be proactive about your health and take steps to prevent illness and disease. Being proactive in health means taking steps to 
		improve your health before you get sick. This includes things like eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and managing stress. 
		It also means getting regular checkups with your doctor. An annual physical is a preventive care visit that allows your doctor to assess your overall 
		health and identify any potential problems.<br>There are many benefits to being proactive in health. By taking steps to prevent illness and disease, you can:

		<li>Live longer</li><br>
		<li>Have a better quality of life</li><br>
		<li>Reduce your risk of chronic diseases</li><br>
		<li>Save money on healthcare costs</li><br>
		</ol>
		
		<p>If you haven't had an annual physical in the past year, it's time to schedule one. 
		Your doctor can help you create a personalized plan to improve your health and prevent illness.</p>
