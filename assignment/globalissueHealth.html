	<h3><b>Causes of Monkey Pox disease</b></h3>
	<p>Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, which belongs to the same family of viruses (Poxviridae) as smallpox.
	The primary causes and transmission modes are:<br>

	<b>1. Direct Contact:</b><br>
	Monkeypox can be transmitted through direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or lesions of infected animals. 
	Common reservoir animals include rodents and primates.<br>
	
	<b>2. Human-to-Human Transmission:</b></br>
	It can spread from person to person through respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact.
	Transmission can also occur through contact with contaminated clothing or bedding used by an infected person.
	
	<b>3. Animal-to-Human Transmission:</b><br>
	The virus can be transmitted to humans through the bite or scratch of an infected animal or by handling infected animals.<br>
	
	<h3><b>Occurrence:</h3></b>
	Monkeypox is primarily found in Central and West Africa. Historically, outbreaks have been reported in countries such as:<br>
	1. Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire)<br>
	2. Nigeria<br>
	3. Cameroon<br>
	4. Central African Republic<br>
	5. Gabon<br>
	In recent years, there have been cases reported outside of Africa, primarily in travelers who have returned from endemic areas 
	or through human-to-human transmission in non-endemic countries.
	
	<h3><b>Prevention and Control Measures:</h3></b>
	<b>1. Vaccination:</b></br>
	<b>Smallpox Vaccine:</b> The smallpox vaccine has been shown to provide some protection against monkeypox. In some regions, 
	vaccination programs may be used during outbreaks.<br>
	
	<b>2. Avoid Contact with Infected Animals:</b><br>
	Avoid handling or consuming bushmeat (wild animals) in areas where monkeypox is known to occur.
	Practice good hygiene and wear protective clothing if handling animals in endemic areas.<br>
	
	
	<b>3. Avoid Contact with Infected Individuals:</b><br>
	Isolate infected individuals to prevent the spread to others.
	Use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves, and gowns when caring for infected individuals.<br>
	
	<b>4. Good Hygiene Practices:</b><br>
	Regularly wash hands with soap and water, especially after contact with potentially contaminated surfaces or animals.
	Avoid touching your face, particularly your mouth, nose, and eyes, with unwashed hands.<br></p>

	<h4 style="text-align:center">Maternal and Child Health</h4>
	</div><br>
	
	<h3><b>Causes of Maternal Health:</h3></b>
	<p>1. Pregnancy Complications:<br>
	> Pre-eclampsia/Eclampsia: High blood pressure and organ damage during pregnancy.<br>
	> Hemorrhage: Excessive bleeding during or after childbirth.<br>
	> Infections: Such as sepsis or infections of the reproductive tract.<br>
	> Obstructed Labor: Complications during childbirth that can lead to severe outcomes if not managed promptly.<br>
	
	<b>2. Chronic Conditions:</b>
	> Diabetes: Gestational diabetes or pre-existing diabetes can affect pregnancy.<br>
	> Hypertension: Chronic high blood pressure can lead to complications.<br>

	<h3><b>Causes of Child Health:</b></h3>
	1. Malnutrition:<br>
	> Under-nutrition: Inadequate intake of essential nutrients leading to stunted growth or wasting.<br>
	> Micronutrient Deficiencies: Lack of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A or iron.<br>
	
	2. Infectious Diseases:<br>
	> Respiratory Infections: Such as pneumonia.<br>
	> Diarrheal Diseases: Caused by poor sanitation and hygiene.<br>
	> Vaccine-Preventable Diseases: Such as measles or whooping cough.<br>

	<h3><b>Targeted Age for Maternal Health and Child Health:</b></h3>
	- Pregnant Women: Typically, care focuses on women from conception through childbirth and the postpartum period.<br>
	Child Health:<br>
	- Infants: From birth to 1 year.<br>
	- Children: From 1 year to adolescence (typically up to 18 years).<br>
	
	<h3><b>Prevention Strategies for Maternal Health:</b></h3>
	<b>1. Access to Quality Prenatal Care:</b><br>
	- Regular check-ups during pregnancy to monitor and manage health.<br>
	- Screening and treatment for conditions like diabetes and hypertension.<br>
	
	<b>2. Skilled Birth Attendants:</b><br>
	- Ensuring that childbirth is attended by trained healthcare professionals to manage complications.<br>
	
	<b>3. Education and Counseling:</b><br>
	- Providing information on nutrition, prenatal care, and safe childbirth practices.<br>
	
	<h3><b>Prevention Strategies for Child Health:</b></h3>
	<b>1. Immunization:</b><br>
	- Ensuring children receive vaccinations according to national immunization schedules to protect against infectious diseases.<br>
	
	<b>2. Nutrition:</b><br>
	- Promoting exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods.<br>
	- Ensuring a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients for growing children.<br>
	
	<b>3. Sanitation and Hygiene:</b><br>
	- Improving access to clean water and sanitation facilities.<br>
	- Educating families on proper handwashing and hygiene practices.<br></p>
